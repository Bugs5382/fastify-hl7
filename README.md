# Fastify HL7

A Fastify Hl7 Plugin Developed in Pure TypeScript.
It uses the [node-hl7-client](https://github.com/Bugs5382/node-hl7-client) and [node-hl7-server](https://github.com/Bugs5382/node-hl7-server) plugin as a wrapper.

The build exports this to valid ESM and CJS for ease of cross-compatibility.
